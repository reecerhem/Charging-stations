Topic: EV Charging Station Route Optimization Application

The goal is to develop an application that, given a starting point in a network of 23 nodes (including
4 charging stations), finds the shortest path to each charging station and recommends the most
efficient route based on distance and other relevant factors.

1. Understanding the Problem
   - Understand the problem statement: The problem involves finding the shortest paths from a starting point to various destination points in a graph.
   - Identify the data requirements: The algorithm requires a graph representation and starting/destination points.

2. Algorithm Selection
   - Choose Dijkstra's algorithm: Dijkstra's algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs with non-negative edge weights.

3. Designing the Algorithm
   - Understand Dijkstra's algorithm:
   - Initialize distances from the starting point to all other vertices as infinity, except for the starting point, which is zero.
   - Repeat until all vertices are processed:
   - Select the vertex with the minimum distance that is not yet processed.
   - Update the distances of its adjacent vertices.
   - Mark the selected vertex as processed.
   - Implement the algorithm:
   - Create a function `shortestPath()` to implement Dijkstra's algorithm.
   - Maintain data structures to store distances, visited vertices, and parent nodes.
   - Update distances and parent nodes during traversal.

4. Input Data Handling
   - Define input data format: Use a text file to represent the graph adjacency matrix, where each cell represents the weight of an edge.
   - Read input data: Implement a function `loadData()` to read data from the text file and convert it into a suitable data structure.

5. Output Presentation
   - Displaying paths: Implement a function `printPath()` to print the shortest path from the starting point to a destination.
   - Displaying solutions: Implement a function `printSolution()` to present the solution for each destination point.

6. User Interaction
   - Input from the user: Allow the user to choose a starting point and interactively select destinations.
   - Handle user input: Implement a loop to process user choices and display the corresponding shortest paths.

7. Testing and Debugging
   - Test individual components: Verify the correctness of each function by providing sample inputs and comparing outputs with expected results.
   - Test the complete system: Test the entire system with various scenarios to ensure correct functionality and error handling.
   - Debugging: Identify and fix any errors or unexpected behaviors encountered during testing.

8. Documentation and Maintenance
   - Document the code: Provide comments and documentation to explain the purpose and functionality of each function and component.
   - Maintainability: Ensure that the code is structured and organized for ease of maintenance and future enhancements.


9. Deployment
   - Deploy the code: Once tested and finalized, deploy the code for actual usage.
   - Provide user instructions: Offer clear instructions on how to use the program and interpret the results.

10. Continuous Improvement
   - Gather feedback: Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
   - Iterate: Incorporate feedback and suggestions to enhance the functionality, usability, and performance of the code.
